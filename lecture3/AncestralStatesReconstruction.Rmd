# Quantitative states

There are two main options for reconstructing the ancestral states of continuous variables: 
reconstructions based on maximum likelihood (ML) and reconstructions based on phylogenetic 
independent contrasts (pic). However, the pic apprach is less interesting because it only 
considers the parameter values of the descendant nodes (and not of the whole tree) when 
estimating the estimates at a node. For this reason, we will focus here on the ML approach.

### Prepare seed plant data

Throughout this tutorial, we will use the seed plant phylogeny and trait data from Paquette 
et al. (2015). Let's load it and prepare it.

```{r "Open_seed_plant_data", message=FALSE}
# Load ape
require(ape)
# Import datasets
seedplantstree <- read.nexus("./data/seedplants.tre")
seedplantsdata <- read.csv2("./data/seedplants.csv")
# Remove species for which we don't have complete data
seedplantsdata <- na.omit(seedplantsdata)
# Remove species in the tree that are not in the data matrix
species.to.exclude <- seedplantstree$tip.label[!(seedplantstree$tip.label %in% 
                                                   seedplantsdata$Code)]
seedplantstree <- drop.tip(seedplantstree,species.to.exclude)
rm(species.to.exclude)
# Name the rows of the data.frame with the species codes used as tree labels
rownames(seedplantsdata) <- seedplantsdata$Code
seedplantsdata <- seedplantsdata[,-1]
# Order the data in the same order as the tip.label of the tree. In the present 
# example, this was already the case.
seedplantsdata <- seedplantsdata[seedplantstree$tip.label,]
# Create a factor for a categorical variable
height <- factor(seedplantsdata$height)
names(height) <- rownames(seedplantsdata)
# Create a vector for a continuous character
maxH <- seedplantsdata$maxH
names(maxH) <- rownames(seedplantsdata)
```

## Maximum likelihood

It is possible to reconstruct ancestral states by maximum likelihood using the Brownian 
Motion model. This is the method of Schluter et al. (1997), implemented in the `ace` function 
of the `ape` package.

```{r "ML_continuous_reconstruction"}
# Ancestral state reconstruction
MLreconstruction <- ace(maxH, seedplantstree, type="continuous",
                        model="BM", method="ML")
# The maximum likelihood estimates:
MLreconstruction$ace
# The 95% confidence interval around the estimates
MLreconstruction$CI95
```

Once you have inferred the ancestral states, you can visualize them on the tree.

```{r "Tree_plotting", fig.height=8, messsage=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
# Breakdown continuous trait in categories
maxH.cat <- cut(maxH,breaks=9,labels=FALSE)
# Same thing for internal nodes
maxH.nodes.cat <- cut(MLreconstruction$ace,breaks=9,labels=FALSE)
# Color palette
require(RColorBrewer)
ColorPalette <- brewer.pal(n = 9, name = "Blues")
# Plotting
plot(seedplantstree, type="p", use.edge.length = TRUE, label.offset=0.01,cex=0.6)
tiplabels(pch=21,bg=ColorPalette[maxH.cat],col="black",cex=1,adj=0.505)
nodelabels(pch=21,bg=ColorPalette[maxH.nodes.cat],cex=1,col="gray32",)
op<-par(xpd=TRUE)
legend(0,0,legend=levels(cut(maxH,breaks=8)),
       col=ColorPalette,pch=20,bty="n",cex=0.7,pt.cex=1.5,ncol=4)
par(op) #reset graphical parameters to defaults
```

## Warning

It is important to note that the reconstruction will be good **if** the model is good. 
Unfortunately, this is difficult to know. Also, because the reconstruction depends on 
the observed states and because of the existing models, it will never be possible to 
obtain an ancestral state at a node that is more extreme than the decesndant nodes. This 
is even more evident when looking at a traitgram.

```{r "traitgram", message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
require(phytools)
phenogram(seedplantstree,c(maxH,MLreconstruction$ace))
```

For these reasons, it is important to take great care when interpreting these results.


# Qualitative states

It is also possible to reconstruct ancestral character states for qualitative (discrete) 
characters. There are a lot more options for these analyses.

## Joint versus marginal state reconstruction

There are two types of ancestral state reconstruction possible with qualitative (discrete) 
traits: marginal and joint. The joint estimation will find the best combination of ancestral 
states over all nodes of the tree. In contrast, the marginal estimation will maximize the 
probability of the states at a node, integrating over all possible states at all other nodes 
(that is, considering all the possible states at those other nodes). In some instances, the 
two approaches can give very different results.

## Prior probabilities at the root

In any reconstructions, we need to give a prior on the probabilities of the different states 
at the root. This can be set 1) at equal probabilities for all states (a flat prior), 2) using 
the stationary distribution of the model, or 3) using the empirical frequency amongst the 
species sampled. This choice can have important repercussions. This is especially true because 
there is little useful data to infer the states at the root, so the prior probability dominates 
the posterior. As we will see below with examples, the root state probabilities is often very 
close to the prior probabilities. For this reason, it is better not to interpret the results 
obtained at the root of a phylogeny (Gascuel and Steel, 2014).

## Test different evolutionary models

To reconstruct the ancestral state at the nodes of a tree with makimum likelihood, we need an 
evolutionary model (for a good introduction to likelihood models, see Baum and Smith, 2012). 
This model will dictate how frequently character states change between them.  The models can 
be anything between the simplest model where all rates are equal to the most complex where 
all transition rates are different. These models are generally represented by a transition 
matrix that quantifies the probability of change from one state to the other in any infinitesimal 
amount of time. For instance, the following matrix represent the simplest model for three 
characters states (1, 2, 3), the equal rates (ER) model:

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | - | $q$ | $q$ |     
| 2 | $q$ | - | $q$ |    
| 3 | $q$ | $q$ | - |

The $q$ represents the instantaneous rate between these states in an infinitesimal amount 
of time. You can notice that with this ER model, all rates are the same. The main diagonal 
elements are constrained to be equal to minus the sum of the other elements in the row.

In contrast, the following table represent the All Rates Different (ARD) model:

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | - | $q_{12}$ | $q_{13}$ |     
| 2 | $q_{21}$ | - | $q_{23}$ |    
| 3 | $q_{31}$ | $q_{32}$ | - |

In the preceeding table, $q_{12}$ represents the instataneous transition rate from character 
1 to character 2. Note that this model is not symmetric. That is $q_{12} \neq q_{21}$.

But which model should we choose? A good approach is to select the model that gives the best 
fit to the data (it maximizes it's likelihood). We will make a test with the seed plant data 
on plant height. We'll compare the equal rates (ER) and the all rates different (ARD) model. 
Also, we will also test a custom model in which there are two rates: one rate between neighboring 
categories (small <-> medium; medium <-> large) and another one for the other (small <-> large). 
This custom model is symmetric because the rate is the same in both directions.

We will compare the models using the AICc, which is the AIC corrected for small sample sizes. 
We will use the `fitDiscrete` function of the `geiger` package for this, although it could have 
been done with `ape`.

```{r "Test_evolutionary_models", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(geiger)

# Create a table to store de results
results.anc <- data.frame(
    model=c("ER","ARD","custom"),
    lnL=numeric(3),
    AICc=numeric(3),
    params=numeric(3)
)

# Fit ER and store the results
ER_fit <- fitDiscrete(seedplantstree,height,model="ER")
results.anc[1,-1]<- c(lnL=ER_fit$opt$lnL,AICc=ER_fit$opt$aicc,ER_fit$opt$k)

# Fit ARD and store the results
ARD_fit <- fitDiscrete(seedplantstree,height,model="ARD")
results.anc[2,-1]<- c(lnL=ARD_fit$opt$lnL,AICc=ARD_fit$opt$aicc,ARD_fit$opt$k)

# Fit custom model and store the results
custom_fit <- fitDiscrete(seedplantstree,height,
                         model=matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0), 3))
results.anc[3,-1]<- c(lnL=custom_fit$opt$lnL,AICc=custom_fit$opt$aicc,custom_fit$opt$k)

# Order the results by AICc
results.anc <- results.anc[order(results.anc$AICc),]
results.anc
```

You can see that the ARD model provides the best fit to the data and that the ER model 
the worst. You can have a look at the ARD model to see the estimated rates:

```{r "ARD_model"}
ARD_fit
```

By looking at the Q matrix (the matrix of instantaneous change), you can see that the 
rates between the small and tall categories are very small, as expected. But we can 
also note that the rates for an increase in height seems higher that the rates for a 
decrease in height. This suggests that the evolution tends to be directed towards greater 
heights. Let's test such a model. That is, let's have one rate for an increase in height, 
one rate for a decrease in height, and one for the unlikely change between the small and 
tall categories.

```{r "Custom2_Model", warning=FALSE}
# Fit Custom2 model
(increase_fit <- fitDiscrete(seedplantstree,height,
                         model=matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0), 3)))
```

You can see that the AICc for this model, `r increase_fit$opt$aicc`, is lower than the ARD 
model (`r ARD_fit$opt$aicc`). Therefore, this model is the best because of the economy of 
parameters. This is the one we will use in the ancestral character states reconstructions.

## Reconstruct marginal ancestral states with Diversitree

The package `diversitree` is very useful for reconstructing ancestral states on phylogenies .
However, it is a bit complicated in the way you need to format the data.

It uses the mk-n model. M is for Markov, because the modeled process is a
continuous-time Markov chain, and k because it can be generalized to any number of states (k). 
It is frequent to distinguish modelds for two states (mk-2) from models with more than two 
parameters (mk-n).

```{r "diversitree", message=FALSE}
require(diversitree)

# Change character to numeric, because this is the format diversitree accepts
char1 <- as.numeric(height)
names(char1) <- names(height)

# Create mkn model. Note that we use equal probs for all states at the root.
lik.mkn <- make.mkn(seedplantstree, char1, k=3, control=list(root=ROOT.EQUI))
# Look at the different parameters of the model, here the transition rates
argnames(lik.mkn)

# Now create the model using constraints. Remember that 1=medium, 2=small, and
# 3=tall. q12 is the transition rate from 1 to 2, and the symbol '~' indicates an
# equivalency. To 'q21 ~ q13' indicate that the rate q12 will be equal to q13 in
# the model.
lik.mkn.base <- constrain(lik.mkn, q21 ~ q13, q23 ~ q32, q12 ~ q31)

# Create a starting point for the search
p.mkn <- starting.point.musse(seedplantstree, 3)

# Fit the model
fit.mkn <- find.mle(lik.mkn.base, p.mkn[argnames(lik.mkn.base)])

# Model parameters
fit.mkn[1:2]

# Export the marginal ancestral reconstruction at the nodes of the tree
st <- t(asr.marginal(lik.mkn.base,coef(fit.mkn)))
```

We now have ancestral character estimates at each node of the tree. We could 
do many things with them, but we could first plot them on the phylogeny.

We can start by plotting the results with the probabilities of the different 
states at each node.

```{r "Plot_ancestral_states_with_uncertainty", fig.height=7, fig.width=6}
# Vector of colours
co <- c("#1b9e77","#7570b3","#d95f02")
plot(seedplantstree,type="p",FALSE,label.offset=0.6,cex=0.6,no.margin=TRUE,
     edge.color="gray32",tip.color="gray32")
tiplabels(pch=21,bg=co[as.numeric(height)],col="gray32",cex=1,adj=0.6)
nodelabels(pie=st,piecol=co,cex=0.5,col="gray32",)
legend("bottomleft",legend=levels(height),
       pch=20,col=co,bty="n",
       text.col="gray32",cex=0.8,pt.cex=2)
```

Remember that estimates at the root of the tree are unreliable. So interpret this 
with caution (= don't).

In some cases, it is useful to get the state with maximum probability at each node. 
To do this you just need to assign the state at each node with the maximum probability. 
This piece of code does that.

```{r "ML_states_at_ancestral_nodes"}
anc_node<-factor(character(nrow(st)),levels=levels(height))
for(i in 1:length(anc_node)) {
  anc_node[i] <- levels(height)[st[i,]==max(st[i,])]
}
```

You can then plot the results.

```{r "Plot_ancestral_states_with_ML_state", fig.height=7, fig.width=6}
plot(seedplantstree,type="p",FALSE,label.offset=0.6,cex=0.6,no.margin=TRUE,
     edge.color="gray32",tip.color="gray32")
tiplabels(pch=21,bg=co[as.numeric(height)],col="gray32",cex=1,adj=0.6)
nodelabels(pch=21,bg=co[as.numeric(anc_node)],cex=1,col="gray32",)
legend("bottomleft",legend=levels(height),
       pch=20,col=co,bty="n",
       text.col="gray32",cex=0.8,pt.cex=2)
```


## Count the number of changes

Once you have the most likely probabilities at each node of the tree, it is possible 
to calculate the number of changes between each state in the tree. As mentioned above, 
it is a good idea to remove the root from those estimates.

```{r "Count_number_of_changes"}
# Vector with tip and node states
states <- c(as.vector(height),as.vector(anc_node))
# Remove the root nodes from the comparison because ancestral states are not
# reliable
root.node <- as.numeric(names(branching.times(seedplantstree)
                [branching.times(seedplantstree)==max(branching.times(seedplantstree))]))
# Remove root node from the data
edges <- seedplantstree$edge[seedplantstree$edge[,1]!=root.node,]
# Create matrix to store the results
change.matrix <- matrix(nrow=3,ncol=3,0)
rownames(change.matrix) <- colnames(change.matrix) <- levels(height)
# Loop over all branches of the tree to count the number of changes
for (i in 1:nrow(edges)) {
  first_state <- states[edges[i,1]]
  second_state <- states[edges[i,2]]
  change.matrix[seq(1,3,1)[first_state==levels(height)],
                seq(1,3,1)[second_state==levels(height)]] <- 
    change.matrix[seq(1,3,1)[first_state==levels(height)],
                  seq(1,3,1)[second_state==levels(height)]] + 1
}
# The results
change.matrix
```


## Stochastic character mapping

An alternative approach to the estimation of ancestral character state is to use a MCMC 
approach to sample character histories from their posterior distribution. This approach 
is called stochastic character mapping (Huelsenbeck et al. 2003). The idea is to simulate 
different instances of character evolution along the phylogeny. If you do this a large 
number of times, you could estimate the probabilities that a given node is at a give state.

Let's generate one character map for the qualitative character height. We still use the 
same model as above.

```{r "Stochastic_mapping_one_instance", message=FALSE}
require(phytools)
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1234)
# simulate single stochastic character map using empirical Bayes method
chartree <- make.simmap(seedplantstree, height, model=matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0), 3))
cols <- setNames(c("#1b9e77","#7570b3","#d95f02"), sort(unique(height)))
plotSimmap(chartree, cols, pts = FALSE, lwd = 3, fsize=0.6)
add.simmap.legend(colors = cols, vertical = FALSE, prompt = FALSE, x = 0, y = 1)
```

A single simulation is not very useful on its own, because it is very unlikely that 
the character evolved exactly this way. However, if you simulate several maps, then 
you could use this distribution to estimate ancestral states, number of transitions, etc.

```{r "stochastic_mapping", fig.height=7, fig.width=6}
# Simulate 200 stochastic character maps
chartrees <- make.simmap(seedplantstree, height,
                         model=matrix(c(0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0), 3), nsim = 200)
# Output summary information
(res_simmap <- describe.simmap(chartrees, plot = FALSE))
# Plot the tree with posterior probabilities of states at each node
plot(seedplantstree,type="p",FALSE,label.offset=0.6,cex=0.6,no.margin=TRUE,
     edge.color="gray32",tip.color="gray32")
tiplabels(pch=21,bg=co[as.numeric(height)],col="gray32",cex=1,adj=0.6)
nodelabels(pie=res_simmap$ace,piecol=co,cex=0.5,col="gray32")
legend("bottomleft",legend=levels(height),
       pch=20,col=co,bty="n",
       text.col="gray32",cex=0.8,pt.cex=1.5)
```

These reconstructions represent the joint probability of having each state at 
all nodes. This is because it is based on simulations across the whole tree. You 
can see that the estimated states are similar to the ones obtained for marginal 
reconstruction, but not completely so.

Let's now count the number of changes on the tree, again removing the root.

```{r "Count_number_of_changes_2"}
# Assigne state with ML at each node
anc_node<-factor(character(nrow(res_simmap$ace)),levels=levels(height))
for(i in 1:length(anc_node)) {
  anc_node[i] <- levels(height)[res_simmap$ace[i,]==max(res_simmap$ace[i,])]
  }
states <- c(as.vector(height),as.vector(anc_node))
# Remove the root nodes from the comparison because ancestral states are not
# reliable
root.node <- as.numeric(names(branching.times(seedplantstree)
                [branching.times(seedplantstree)==max(branching.times(seedplantstree))]))
edges <- seedplantstree$edge[seedplantstree$edge[,1]!=root.node,]
# Count the number of changes across the tree
change.matrix <- matrix(nrow=3,ncol=3,0)
rownames(change.matrix) <- colnames(change.matrix) <- levels(height)
for (i in 1:nrow(edges)) {
  first_state <- states[edges[i,1]]
  second_state <- states[edges[i,2]]
  change.matrix[seq(1,3,1)[first_state==levels(height)],
                seq(1,3,1)[second_state==levels(height)]] <- 
    change.matrix[seq(1,3,1)[first_state==levels(height)],
                  seq(1,3,1)[second_state==levels(height)]] + 1
}
change.matrix
```


## Parsimony reconstructions

It is possible to obtain a parsimonious character reconstruction using likelihood 
or stochastic mapping if we force the transition rates to be very small. This makes 
sense as when rates of evolution are small, there are few multiple substitutions along 
the branches and at the limit parsimony becomes a likelihood estimator (as for the 
phylogeny reconstruction). However, if there are indications in the data that some 
substitution rates are not very small, then likelihood is the best option.
